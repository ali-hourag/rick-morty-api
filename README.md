## About
Individual project done on May 2023 of the famous series Rick & Morty in which I have used a strongly typed language such as TypeScript.
Moreover, I have implemented styles libraries like Bootstrap and started implementing API requests to the Rick & Morty API.
<br/>
* In this app the user can access data about all episodes, characters and locations of Rick & Morty series.
* User can access it through mobile, tablet and web, since it is responsive!
